My friends, I absolutely do not encourage you to copy this repository, I remind you that any cheat will be detected by our friend the "moulitriche" and that you therefore risk a -42. <br>
Don't risk a -42 for nothing, give your all to have a project you're proud of. However you can look at this repo to get an idea of ​​the work to be done. <br>
But be careful! Looking at this repo to "see the work" or "unblock you" not to copy more than anything else!! <br>
The most important thing is to learn!! <br>
